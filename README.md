## Application features
- Organize list items in specific projects.
- Projects can be created and edited (name only).
- ToDo Items can be added to projects, including priority.
- Each Item can be fully edited, close or re-open dynamically.
- Projects and Item information is saved in the user's local storage
- Local storage can be clean for evaluation purposes (available only for demo) 

## Data Structure Design | OOP

- Each user session creates a 'book' object with an array of projects
- Each 'project' object has properties and an array of To-Do Item Object.
- Each Item Object contains basic properties like title, description, dueDate, priority and status.
- All data objects are created using Factory Functions organized in specific files (todobook.js, todoproject.js, todoitem.js) inside the ./src folder.
- Main Application functions are: stoprage (in charge of all storage actions), displaycontroller(in charge of rendering, and listeners generation). These functions are created using the module pattern, hosted in specific files (displaycontroller.js, storage.js)
